TcMenu organisation made this library available for you to use. It takes significant effort to keep all our libraries current and working on a wide range of boards. Please consider making at least a one off donation via the sponsor button if you find it useful. In forks, please keep text to here intact.

## Summary

This library provides logging facilities that are used by all our other libraries. You can consider this like a logging API with a simple implementation that backs onto the serial port by default.

The library works on most Arduino devices, PicoSDK and mbed. You can see our library compatibility matrix: https://tcmenu.github.io/documentation/

You can find examples packaged with it in the `examples` folder. The example should work on most platforms without needing changes. 

## Supporting another output format

The easiest way would be to create another implementation of `LoggingPort` that met the `Print` (or `PrintCompat`) interface, this will then integrate without changing anything. You can see examples of this in `IoLogging.h` for mbed and PicoSDK.
