TcMenu organisation made this library available for you to use. It takes significant effort to keep all our libraries current and working on a wide range of boards. Please consider making at least a one off donation via the sponsor button if you find it useful. In forks, please keep text to here intact.

This library provides several useful extensions that make programming Arduino / mbed for non-trivial apps simpler. You can find examples packaged with it in the `examples` folder.
